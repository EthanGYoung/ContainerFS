Goal: Implementing Bloom Filters for different imgFS and overlayFS layers

Path
	1) Update metadata reader to read in the new image file metadata format
	2) Update FS structure to allow for a Bloom Filter
	3) Update logic on reads and opens to check filter before executing the open/read/write
		- If not path not in filter, can return immediately instead of executing lookup
